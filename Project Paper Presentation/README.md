In this project I analysed paper named - [Feature Selection for Ranking](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/taoqin/papers/qin-sigir07b.pdf) and learned how the proposed Greedy Algorithm for feature selection can be applied on Classification problem. 

I have made an attempt to implement the method and apply it on Wheat data and modelled accordinly to find the testing and training error. The comparsion with other methods is reported in the pdf report.
